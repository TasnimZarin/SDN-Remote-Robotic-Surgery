# üè• A Simulated SDN Environment for Remote Robotic Surgery

A simulation project that demonstrates **remote robotic surgery** using **Software Defined Networking (SDN)**.  
The project shows how latency-sensitive healthcare applications can be supported using SDN by ensuring fast feedback between surgeon and robot modules.  

---

## üìñ Summary
In remote robotic surgery, commands from the surgeon must be executed by the robot with **minimal latency**. If the robot‚Äôs response is delayed, a **Tactile Learner** provides predicted dummy feedback so the surgeon can continue the operation without interruption.  
This project simulates such an environment using **SDN architecture** and demonstrates how software-defined networks can meet the requirements of latency-critical applications.
